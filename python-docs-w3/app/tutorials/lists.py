# List

"""
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, 
the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:
"""

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# List Items

# List Length
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

# Python Collections (Arrays)
"""
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered* and changeable. No duplicate members.
